Quick start Android example for [Banuba SDK Effect API](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk/effect_api/getting_started).
Example shows how to work with [Face Beauty API](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk/effect_api/face_beauty) and [Makeup API](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk/effect_api/makeup).
In both cases the [Makeup effect](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk/generated/effects/Makeup.zip) is used.

# Getting Started

1. Copy `aar` files from the Banuba SDK archive into `libs` dir:
    `BNBEffectPlayer/bin/banuba_sdk/banuba_sdk-release.aar` => `beauty-android-kotlin/libs/`
    `BNBEffectPlayer/banuba_effect_player-release.aar` => `beauty-android-kotlin/libs/`
2. Get and unpack the latest version of `Makeup` effect from [here](https://docs.banuba.com/face-ar-sdk-v1/overview/demo_face_filters).
      The `Makeup` folder should be located in the `beauty-android-kotlin/app/src/main/assets/bnb-resources/effects/` folder.
3. Open the project in Android Studio and run the necessary target using the usual steps.
